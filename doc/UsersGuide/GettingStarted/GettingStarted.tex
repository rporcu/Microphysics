\section{Introduction}

Welcome to the MFIX-Exa User's Guide!  In this document is an overview 
of MFIX-Exa, a multiphase flow solver hosted on the NETL gitlab site. 

\section{Downloading the Code}

\mfix\ is built on top of the \amrex\ framework.  In order to run
\mfix\, you must download two separate git modules.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Clone/fork the \amrex\ repository:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex
\end{verbatim}

\item Clone/fork the \mfix\ repository:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone http://mfix.netl.doe.gov/gitlab/exa/mfix
\end{verbatim}

Note: when you check out \mfix\ and \amrex\, you will get the {\tt master}
branch of each.   The \mfix\ master branch is guaranteed to be compatible
with the AMReX master branch.
Active development is done on the {\tt development} branch
in each repo, and merged into the {\tt master} branch monthly.
If you wish to use the \mfix\ {\tt development} branch, then you
should also switch to the {\tt development} branch for \amrex.
Note that in order to use the most recent version of the code you 
will need to update \amrex\ by typing
\begin{verbatim}
git pull
\end{verbatim}
in the \amrex\ directory, and similarly in the \mfix\ directory.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Building and Running the Code}

There are detailed instructions for how to build and run the \mfix\ code in
the README.md file in the home directory.   The README.md is also readable at

\begin{verbatim}
https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/gitlab/exa/mfix
\end{verbatim}

\section{Visualization}

Plotfiles written by MFIX-Exa can be viewed using the 
\visit, \paraview, and \yt\ packages.  Particle data can be viewed using \paraview.
Please see Chapter 9 of the AMReX User's Guide (available in AMReX/Docs)
for more detail about using all of these visualization packages.
