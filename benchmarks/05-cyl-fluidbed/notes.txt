This case should now be setting up the correct geometry for
the fluid and particles. However, the level set is not being
generated for particles which causes the code to crash at the
first call to "Evolving Particle...". Therefore, the case is
setup to have no particles.


To enable particles, uncomment the "mfix.particle_init_type"
line in the inputs file.
