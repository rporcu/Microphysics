# Benchmark cases for MFIX-Exa


## Overview of cases

* **_DEM01_ Homogeneous Cooling System** [1]
  User files create the initial particle layout for all processors and collect/report the granular temperature of the system over time. The run script (runtests) is mainly for local testing but could be modified to generatue queue submission scripts.
