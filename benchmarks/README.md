# Benchmark cases for MFIX-Exa


## Overview of benchmark cases

* **DEM01** _Homogeneous Cooling System_ [1]

User files create the initial particle layout for all processors and collect/report the granular temperature of the system over time. The run script (runtests) is mainly for local testing but could be modified to generatue queue submission scripts.

* **FLD01:** _Lid-driven cavity flow_ [2]
