!  Purpose: This routine is called within the discrete phase time loop !
!  after the source terms are applied and the time step updated. The   !
!  The user may insert code in this routine or call user defined       !
!  subroutines.                                                        !

!  This routine is called from the time loop, but no indices (fluid    !
!  cell or particle) are defined.                                      !
!                                                                      !
