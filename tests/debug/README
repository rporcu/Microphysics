This folder contains the following tests:

1) FLD05-xy = periodic vorteces on xy plane
2) FLD05-xz = periodic vorteces on xz plane
3) FLD05-yz = periodic vorteces on yz plane

To run a test, run "run_FLD05-<plane>" from within
your build directory. "<plane>" can be "xy", "xz", or "yz".
The plot files are stored in "<path/to/build/dir>/debug/FLD05-<plane>".

To select the form of the convective term, i.e. conservative or
convective, edit the parameter "convective_form" at line 27 of "projection_mod.f90"
and re-compile.

convective_form = .true.   --->  u grad(u)

convective_form = .false.  --->  div(uu)


To choose the order of the space discretization ( for convective form ONLY )
edit the parameter "upw_order" at line 30 of "convection_mod.f90" and re-compile

upw_order = 1   --> I order upwind for ugrad(u)

upw_order = 2   --> II order upwind for ugrad(u)


ONLY II order spatial discretization is available for the CONSERVATIVE form.
