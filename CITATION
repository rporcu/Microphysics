        abstract = { MFIX-Exa is a computational fluid dynamics-discrete element model (CFD-DEM) code designed to run efficiently on current and next-generation supercomputing architectures. MFIX-Exa combines the CFD-DEM expertise embodied in the MFIX code-which was developed at NETL and is used widely in academia and industry with the modern software framework, AMReX, developed at LBNL. The fundamental physics models follow those of the original MFIX, but the combination of new algorithmic approaches and a new software infrastructure will enable MFIX-Exa to leverage future exascale machines to optimize the modeling and design of multiphase chemical reactors. }
